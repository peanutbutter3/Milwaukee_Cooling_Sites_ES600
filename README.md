<h3>Context and Need</h3>
&emsp;&emsp;As climate change is driving warmer temperatures, more people than ever are becoming vulnerable to heat-related health effects. As of 2024, the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/extreme-heat">United Nations</a> estimates that extreme heat waves endanger 2.4 billion workers, which is 70% of the global workforce. In Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, many policymakers focus on winter conditions, regulating that landlords supply heat. However, this is not the same during the summer, and as of September 2, 2024, there were 1014 heat-related emergency department visits across Wisconsin, up 25% from 2023 according to the <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2024/09/05/heat-illnesses-and-deaths-are-getting-worse-in-wisconsin-data-show/75072520007/">Wisconsin Department of Health Services</a>. As a mitigation, the Milwaukee County Emergency Department organizes life-saving <a href="https://city.milwaukee.gov/Health/Cooling-Sites">cooling sites</a> to open during extreme heat advisories, watches, or warnings.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;During a heat wave, people living in low-income communities or with disabilities are the most likely to be negatively impacted. They are also often the least likely to seek help due to physical or monetary constraints. To visualize this disparity, Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) maps are created from a z-score test using health, income, and minority data. For more information about the methods of the 2023 Milwaukee HVI map, consult the HVI slide deck provided.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Cooling sites also vary widely, including pools, air-conditioned public buildings, social service organizations, and community organizations. Water-feature cooling sites, such as splash pads and pools, require swimming skills and may not be suitable for everyone, as children need to be supervised and these sites may introduce increased risks. These sites are not always free, and do not protect against the elements.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The accessibility and need determine the usefulness of cooling sites. A study has not yet been conducted regarding the ease of access to these cooling sites in Milwaukee County, and if the most vulnerable populations are addressed.<br><br>
<h3>Methods</h3>
&emsp;&emsp;The project was first inspired by ideas and insights from Natalie Meier, from the Milwaukee County Office of Emergency Management, who played a key role in helping us refine our objectives and connect with additional resources. Natalie introduced us to Ryan Honeck, the GIS Coordinator for the City of Milwaukee Health Department, who greatly supported our mapping efforts by providing data and engaging in valuable discussions. His input guided our approach to spatial analysis and helped shape the overall direction of the project. We collaborated with them to find a project that was feasible and filled an area of need.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Initially, we aimed to update Milwaukee County’s Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI). However, it was difficult to obtain and compile data for key variables within the time frame for our project, which made this initial goal challenging. The original scope was ambitious, including plans for a series of maps analyzing public transportation accessibility including bus routes and stops. Over time, the project’s focus shifted based on feedback from community partners and data limitations, aiming for a more manageable scope that still met the needs of stakeholders. Key changes included moving away from county-level comparisons due to scope limitations and shifting focus to cooling center identification and prioritization. We altered our response to the community-partner-identified needs to invest time and resources into cooling center identification and recognize what areas would be valuable to put efforts into for increasing these resources for vulnerable populations. 
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;We compiled service area analysis maps via ArcGIS Pro overlaying HVI. The maps were collected from Ryan Honeck or online via data portals and the U.S. Census Bureau. For future data collection, be aware of the difference between Milwaukee County and the City of Milwaukee datasets, as the City of Milwaukee only covers a portion of Milwaukee County. Our walking limits are based on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA’s) Recommended Alert Limits for unacclimated workers (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2016-106/pdfs/2016-106.pdf">pg. 126, Figure 8-1</a>) during extreme heat to simulate walking distances. The first shows accessibility for all of the cooling sites, while the second only shows non-water feature cooling centers.<br>
<h3>Results and Future Work</h3>
&emsp;&emsp;The service area analysis maps show a stark need in the northwestern portion of Milwaukee County, which is also currently lacking in other emergency services including food banks. It is important to note that 12 of these non-water feature cooling sites are part of the Milwaukee Housing Authority, which have since been removed as cooling sites, so our service area analysis will be even more sparse, especially in the inner city of Milwaukee. These maps will serve decision-makers in actively seeking new cooling sites and creating awareness for underserved communities.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Our work is helpful for community partners and decision-makers as it gives them the materials to visualize the spatial distribution of resources and vulnerabilities. This allows for a targeted approach to addressing areas of need and allocating resources effectively. From our project, our partners can reach out to expand cooling centers for vulnerable populations. However, it is less useful for Milwaukee County residents seeking to engage with the information, as it does not include an interactive mapping or informational component. In future work, to have a focus on supporting residents, an improvement could develop an interactive map, similar to existing community-centric tools. This format would make it easier for residents to locate cooling centers and learn about the services they offer.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Our maps help to identify opportunities to engage the private sector and non-government entities as cooling centers, encouraging these organizations to open their doors during extreme heat events. This has proven to be an ongoing effort involving numerous questions and challenges, including funding and logistical concerns, so our work hopes to alleviate some of the burden by demonstrating areas to target. Additionally, the project offers a map overlaying existing cooling centers with the Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI), providing a visual tool to help locate areas of greatest need.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;This information will likely need to be updated consistently as cooling centers are added and removed annually. The availability of cooling centers may change over time, as seen with Public Housing Authority buildings, which previously served as emergency cooling centers but no longer fulfill this purpose. Transportation challenges are another significant barrier. Many residents struggle to access cooling centers due to limited public transit options. Engaging in community-based research of feelings surrounding safety and security to understand barriers would support making decisions for more people to get help.  A deeper analysis of transportation networks could examine the efficiency of bus routes, the quality of bus shelters near cooling centers, and connectivity between vulnerable residential areas and cooling sites. Long distances to bus stops, indirect routes, or the lack of walkable paths often deter people from utilizing these centers. Another version of this service area analysis map can be completed, only utilizing bus routes and stops instead of walking. The data to complete all of these analyses are located in the data folder. 
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;For future work, there is a potential for outreach to private community buildings to serve as cooling sites. More mapping can also be achieved to further scrutinize these cooling sites and search for new sites. Future projects can examine land zoning to estimate the impact of cooling sites serving residential areas or creating a population-based network, finding more cooling sites in higher-populated residential areas. Additionally, further efforts could integrate population density considerations to prioritize resource allocation in areas with the highest population density whose needs are not being met. Gathering detailed information about the resources and services offered at existing cooling centers, such as activities offered, medical assistance, or extended hours, could also help expand their capacity and better serve residents during extreme heat events. Connecting this work with Heat Health Alerts and enhancing community awareness could improve the effectiveness of cooling centers. Communication strategies could raise awareness about the dangers of extreme heat and inform residents about the availability and resources of nearby cooling centers. By addressing these gaps, the project can better support community resilience and ensure that cooling centers meet the needs of vulnerable populations.
